# ABOUT THE PROJECT:

## Background
Numerous studies have revealed that children and adolescents with chronic health or medical condition, as well as their caregivers, are at an increased risk for depression and anxiety, with serious direct and indirect negative effects on treatment adherence, family functioning, and health-related quality of life [1]–[3]. Additionally, living with a chronic conditions can place adolescents at higher risk for poor educational, vocational, and social outcomes and lead to isolation from peers [4], [5]. Regular participation in social activities with peers is particularly crucial in adolescence where it can provide a critical key component for developing healthy psychological development [6], [7]. Moreover, support from peers can also play a significant role in helping young people with chronic health or mental conditions cope with the illness and with its “inherent psychosocial and lifestyle changes” [8].
In order to address some of the issues inherent to social isolation and lack of peer support, we propose a novel method of engaging adolescents with chronic health or mental conditions through role-playing game (RPG) communities.
A tabletop RPG is a role-playing game in which the players “describe their characters' actions through speech” and determine the actions of their characters based on their character sheets [8], [9]. The outcomes of the characters' actions are determined by a formal system of rules and guidelines. “Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game” [9]–[11].

## Specific Aims of the Study

* To determine if regular participation in a guided multiplayer role-playing game has positive impact on self-reported social isolation, social support, and depression in adolescents with chronic health or mental health conditions
* To identify participant participation and engagement with RPG game-based interventions
* To determine if (and under what conditions) participation in a multiplayer RPG facilitates chronic illness-related conversation among peers

## The Roleplaying System
We will be using the tabletop roleplaying system MASKS for our online gaming community. Masks is a tabletop roleplaying system in which players assume the roles of young superheroes in a team (like the Teen Titans or the X-men) as they come of age in the face of superheroic trials and tribulations. The players select playbooks, which are based around the type of superhero they want to be, and create their own characters to play as. For example, a player who wants to be a hero who has a secret identity to protect their normal teenage life, like Spiderman or Ms. Marvel, would pick the Janus playbook.

Despite "tabletop" being in the name, physical proximity is not required to play Masks or most other games of its kind. Games can easily be conducted using voice chat over telepresence with tools like Discord and Roll20, allowing for play anywhere with reliable internet access.
It is similar to other tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons because the key element of gameplay is acting as a character in scenarios designed and led by a gamemaster (GM). By acting as their characters in response to these scenarios, the group creates a narrative that they experience together. Dice and other tools to decide outcomes are used to add an element of unpredictability to the narrative, and aid in the improvisation process.

However, Masks is different because its mechanics are more focused around a character's emotional state and personal development than in most other games. For example, the Label system explains mechanically how the characters grow into their powers based on the realizations they make about themselves, and the influence of others around them. Instead of taking damage in ways that could lead to their characters dying, the system focuses more on the feelings that challenges and enemies can impose on the characters. A character who fails to use their powers against a formidable opponent in a stressful situation could feel insecure, or potentially, angry. By focusing on emotional states rather than physical health, players are free to invest in their characters without fear of them dying, while being given opportunities to create dramatic and narrative tension.
